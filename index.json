AWS Site-to-Site VPN allows the creation of an encrypted VPN connection between the on-premises network and AWS, supporting high-security standards, ensuring strict security, and maintaining a stable connection with your network system.\nBy using AWS Site-to-Site VPN, you will gain the following benefits:\nEnsure high security with data encryption throughout the transmission process. Easily integrate with other AWS services such as EC2, VPC, S3, CloudWatch, etc. Centralized management and simplified connection with multiple branches. Support routing protocols like Static Route and BGP to optimize routing. AWS Site-to-Site VPN helps save time and costs, while simplifying the deployment and maintenance of secure connections between on-premises and AWS. With these advantages, you can also use VPN instead of Direct Connect, which helps save costs when it comes to transmission lines. VPN Cost of Site-to-Site VPN is calculated based on a fixed cost of approximately 36 USD per month for one VPN Connection. This cost does not include the traffic cost going out of the VPC.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "We connect the On-premise Data Center to Amazon VPC using a Fortigate hardware VPN. To establish a Site to Site VPN connection, we need to create and configure a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and a Customer Gateway (CGW).\nThe Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) is a control center for managing the VPN connection installed at the AWS end. A Customer Gateway (CGW) is a component that represents the hardware or software VPN device installed at the customer end, which in this case is Fortigate. A VPN tunnel will be established once data traffic is transmitted between AWS and the customer\u0026rsquo;s network. In this connection, we must specify the type of routing used to ensure the security and quality of data transmission. If the CGW on the customer side supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), dynamic routing must be set in the VPN connection configuration. Amazon VPC provides various types of CGWs, each associated with a VPG, but a single VPG can be linked with multiple CGWs (many-to-one design). To support this model, the CGW’s IP address must be unique within a region. Amazon VPC also provides the necessary information for network administrators to configure the CGW and establish a VPN connection to the VPG on AWS. The VPN connection always includes two Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) tunnels to ensure high availability.\nBelow are the key characteristics of VPG, CGW, and VPN:\nVPG is the endpoint of the VPN tunnel on AWS. CGW can be a hardware device or a software application located at the customer\u0026rsquo;s end of the VPN tunnel. You must initiate the VPN tunnel connection from the CGW to the VPG. VPG supports both dynamic routing (BGP) and static routing. The VPN connection always has two tunnels to ensure high availability of the connection to the VPC from the customer site. This lab helps us learn how to set up a Site to Site VPN connection in AWS. In practice, this solution is quite popular among enterprises due to the widespread use and ease of configuration of Fortigate devices, which are commonly used in businesses. AWS also provides configuration guides for each type of Customer Gateway device in a configuration file. The only concern for the customer is to prepare the internet connection, from which a secure and private tunnel (using IPSec) is created to connect to AWS via the AWS VPN tunnel. Within the scope of this lab, we assume that we have a Main office (VPC ASG) and a Branch office located in an On-premises Data Center to differentiate the network. In the VPC, we create an EC2 instance with SSM enabled and a PC in the DC. Our task is to configure the VPN so that the Private IP addresses on both ends can ping each other using the Site-to-Site VPN.\nAppendix:\nCreate Virtual Private Gateway Configure Customer Gateway Create VPN Connection "

It is one of the most important protocols that help network systems exchange information and determine the optimal path for data transmission. BGP is designed to operate in large network systems, especially in the global Internet network, where hundreds of thousands of networks need to be interconnected. BGP can determine the data transmission path based on multiple attributes such as bandwidth, quality, and the number of network hops the data needs to traverse. This helps the protocol choose the most optimal path to transmit data from source to destination efficiently and quickly.\nAdditionally, BGP plays a role in keeping the Internet operating stably by periodically updating routing information, reliably and flexibly. BGP is a good choice for large, complex networks that require automation and flexibility if there are many networks. Compared to static routes, BGP has superior advantages:\nAttribute BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) Static Route Automation and Flexibility Automatically learns and adjusts routes when there are changes in the network. Requires manual configuration of all routes, manual updates needed when changes occur. Scalability Suitable for large networks, handles millions of routes. Suitable for small or simple networks, difficult to manage as the network expands. Routing Policies Supports complex routing policies based on multiple attributes. Does not support complex routing policies. Resilience Automatically switches routes in case of failure, ensuring quick recovery. Manual configuration of backup routes required, not flexible. Security Supports security mechanisms like MD5, but requires complex management. Simpler, less prone to attacks but can still be misconfigured. Use Cases Suitable for large, complex networks with multiple ISPs, requiring automation and quick recovery. Suitable for small, simple networks, not requiring automation or complex recovery.

	"content": "In this section, we will guide you on how to deploy the environment as in sections 2.1 and 2.2 using Infrastructure as Code. Since the process is repeated many times, creating and configuring the lab in sections 2.1 and 2.2 takes a lot of time. Therefore, this section will guide you through some basic commands to deploy the environment as in sections 2.1 and 2.2 using Terraform.\nThis code will create the entire environment as in sections 2.1 and 2.2 Code here\nTo use and write Terraform, you need to learn how to install and write code with Terraform:\nInstall Terraform Module deployment syntax Use available built-in modules Install Terraform plugin for VS Code To deploy using Terraform on Amazon, you need to install and configure the AWS CLI with access key and secret key credentials. Refer to:\nInstall and get familiar with AWS CLI on Windows Usage Instructions:\nOpen the INFRAASCODE_AWS source folder in VS Code Navigate to the Singapore directory Find the terraform.tfvars file to declare the necessary information to initialize all resources in labs 2.1 and 2.2 region = \u0026ldquo;ap-southeast-1\u0026rdquo; availability_zone_1 = \u0026ldquo;ap-southeast-1a\u0026rdquo; availability_zone_2 = \u0026ldquo;ap-southeast-1b\u0026rdquo; cidr_block = \u0026ldquo;10.10.0.0/16\u0026rdquo; public_subnet_ips = [\u0026ldquo;10.10.1.0/24\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;10.10.2.0/24\u0026rdquo;] private_subnet_ips = [\u0026ldquo;10.10.100.0/24\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;10.10.200.0/24\u0026rdquo;] instance_type = \u0026ldquo;t2.micro\u0026rdquo; role_name = \u0026ldquo;SSM-Role\u0026rdquo; Open PowerShell in VS Code. Navigate to the Singapore directory Enter terraform init to download the necessary modules and plugins for AWS. After downloading, enter terraform plan to check the information of the resources to be created. A total of 26 resources will be deployed to AWS After careful checking, enter terraform apply to start deploying resources to AWS Check the information one more time. At Enter a value, enter yes to deploy. Enter no if you do not want to deploy The deployment process takes a few minutes "
